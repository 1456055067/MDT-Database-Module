MDT-Database-script
===================
This is an example of a Powershell script that builds on the MDT Powershell module that Michael Neihaus.  It is designed to read in a csv file containing headers and the computer information.  A template csv file is included in this repo.   

This example loads Mac address, Computer name, Admin Password, and Role. It could easily be adjusted for any set of fields.
